# recipe-website
I am still working on this but so far I have a bare bones website with 4 webpages: 
  - Homepage
  - Recipe 1
  - Recipe 2
  - Recipe 3
There is a navigation bar in the header which is available throughout all the webpages. There is also a footer available  as well on every page.

I've created some very rough styling and content. No actual recipes yet and the styling needs a lot of work, though I like the picture in the header. 

# Still to-do: 
- Chose and insert the actual recipes in recipes.js
  - Ingredients (as a list)
  - Step-by-step insstructions
  - Optional Notes or tips
- Update recipes.ejs to diplay the ingredients and instructions.
- Improve navigation
  - Currently recipe pages only have 'Home' in the nav bar. Maybe it should hav links to all recipes?
  - Fix the background, it's too dark I think.
  - Adjust spacing between the items.
  - Make it fixed at the top so it stays visible when scrolling
- Find and insert pictures (store in /public/images/recipe(#).jpg
  - Update recipes.js to include the image paths
- Turn the titles into the actual names of the recipes
