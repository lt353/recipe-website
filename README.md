# recipe-website
I am still working on this but so far I have a bare bones website with 4 webpages: 
  - Homepage
  - Recipe 1
  - Recipe 2
  - Recipe 3

There is a navigation bar in the header which is available throughout all the webpages. There is also a footer available  as well on every page.

I've created some very rough styling and content. No actual recipes yet and the styling needs a lot of work, though I like the picture in the header. 

# Recently completed: 
- Improved navigation
  - Fixed the background (lightened)
  - Adjusted spacing between the items.
  - Make it fixed at the top so it stays visible when scrolling
- Turn the titles into the actual names of the recipes
- Added a background to the body and adjusted the styling of main (semi-transparent white box) so that the text could still stand out. 
- Adjusted styling of the navigation links on homepage. 
- Created a bit of a stylized border at the bottom of th header. 
- Fixed the footer to the bottom of the page. 


# Still to-do: 
- Insert the actual recipes in recipes.js
  - Ingredients (as a list)
  - Step-by-step insstructions
  - Optional Notes or tips
- Update recipes.ejs to diplay the ingredients and instructions.
- Find and insert pictures (store in /public/images/recipe(#).jpg)
  - Update recipes.js to include the image paths
- Maybe add more of a writeup above the recipes on the homepage.
