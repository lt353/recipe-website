        <h1>Welcome to My Recipe Collection</h1>
        <p>
            When Iâ€™m not studying hard for my ICS 360 class and learning all about web development, 
            I love to cook! Making dinner for my family is something I truly enjoy, and these are just 
            a few of my go-to recipes. I hope you enjoy them as much as we do!
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether it's a cozy Green Thai Chicken Curry, Crispy Chicken Griddle Tacos, or 
            a classic Chicken Marsala, I love experimenting with flavors while keeping things simple.
        </p>
